# Overview

The C3S list from Dec. 2020 has 58 variables with 18 structures.

In terms of the dimensionality, there are just three combinations:

* Global, time-invariant fields on a single vertical level;
* Global, time varying fields on a single vertical level;
* Global, time varying fields on 19 pressure levels.

In the CMIP6 request, differences temporal sampling (e.g. daily versus monthly) are noy considered as different structures.
